The folder Datasets is not included, you can either download the required Datesets according to the file tree or you can download the zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lEX7Jo9BJv3Ve2bW1-RuMCyoY3MJ0l8/view?usp=sharing). The checkpoints can also be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwYsMsFN71HugFLTRjOX1CGaXkLCsBis/view?usp=sharing) in case you accidentally updated the original one during the training process.

### The environment

My advice is to create a new conda environment from the `environment.yml` file in this repo or find it [here]
You can simply do it by: 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## 2. How to check the result of this project
### If your server or computer is GPU ready

You can simply check by input:

```python
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

If the output is `True`, then congratulation that you can start from the training by exectuting the corresponding file to solve the Task A and B. 



Install following packages and dependencies in order:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make valgrind
sudo apt-get install emacs screen
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo apt-get install python python3-pip
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
sudo pip3 install django psycopg2 
```

Test your Django version:
```bash
$ django-admin --version
4.1.5
```

You need ```Django>4.0``` for some new features in Django. Then install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxerces-c-dev libpqxx-dev
sudo apt-get install manpages-posix-dev
pip3 install django-livereload
```

### 2. Clone Project
Git clone my repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0HugoHu/Django-Web-App.git
```

Install all project-specific requirements:
```bash
cd Django-web-app/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Local Database
Setup your local ```postgresql``` database:
```bash
sudo su - postgres
psql
```
Create a user, for convenience, I suggest you to choose the name of your linux logged-in username (e.g., ```abc@dce:~$```: then choose ```abc``` as your name):
```sql
CREATE USER abc;
ALTER USER abc CREATEDB WITH PASSWORD '$PWD'; ## replace $PWD with your password
--  exit postgres (by pressing Ctrl+D)
--  exit the su'ed shell
```
```bash
createdb $nameOfDB # replace $nameOfDB with a meaningful name for your project
```

### 4. Configure APIs and Local Variables
Edit project setting file:
```bash
cd ridesharing
emacs settings.py # or use any editor you want
```

If you want to use docker and deploy this project on web services (e.g., ```AWS EC2``` or ```AWS ECR```), add ```'*'``` to allow all hosts:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '*',]
```

Change your default database to ```postgresql```:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': '$nameOfDB',
        'USER': '$USER',
        'PASSWORD': '$PWD',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
# replace $nameOfDB with your database name, 
# $USER with your username, 
# and $PWD with your password
```

Change your timezone if you are not in Eastern Standard Time:
```python
TIME_ZONE = 'America/New_York'
```

Configure email sending service API. I'm using the ```SendGrid``` API: [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/)

You must first register your personal information on that website, and bind your sender email address. Then use the API Key generator to get your own ```$KEY```. This step is very time-consuming, please refer to other tutorials for help.
```python
SENDGRID_API_KEY = '$KEY'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'apikey'  # this is exactly the value 'apikey'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = SENDGRID_API_KEY
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
```

Add your sender email address:
```python
# The email you'll be sending emails from
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = '$EMAIL'
# replace $EMAIL with your registered and confirmed email address
```

## Run the Server
### 1. Database Model Integrations
Django will automatically create the new table for you based on the ```world/models.py``` file. Apply this creation by:
```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
# or try with python3 manage.py makemigrations ridesharing
# and python3 manage.py makemigrations world
python3 manage.py migrate
```

ðŸŸ¥ If you have any problems creating the tables, you can do it manually by:
```bash
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate world 0001
```

This will generate ```Postgresql schema```, e.g.:
```sql
BEGIN;
##
## Create model Question
##
CREATE TABLE "polls_question" (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "question_text" varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    "pub_date" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;
```
Copy and execute this schema in ```psql```, and you can check your database by (**Remember you must start your ```postgresql``` service first**):
```sql
\l ## to list all databases
\c user_info ## switch to your database
\dt ## show all tables
SELECT * FROM world_user; ## see all records in world_user table
q ## quit
```
### 2. Start Postgresql Service
```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```

### 3. Run Your Website Locally
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 0:8080
```

**ðŸ’  Now enjoy this project!**

## Contribution
**ðŸ”± Developed by Hugo.**

Since I didn't really enroll in this course, this project is only used for self-learning. Some of this project requirements are meaningless and time-consuming for me, so I have not implemented (or just leave the interface) yet.

**Due to the limited time, I did not clean up and refractor the code. I would be glad if someone can further improve this project.**
