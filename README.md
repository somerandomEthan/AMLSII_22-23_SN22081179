The folder Datasets is not included, you can either download the required Datesets according to the file tree or you can download the zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lEX7Jo9BJv3Ve2bW1-RuMCyoY3MJ0l8/view?usp=sharing). The checkpoints can also be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwYsMsFN71HugFLTRjOX1CGaXkLCsBis/view?usp=sharing) in case you accidentally updated the original one during the training process.

### The environment

My advice is to create a new conda environment from the `environment.yml` file in this repo [environment.yml](.\environment.yml)
You can simply do it by: 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## 2. How to check the result of this project

### If your server or computer is GPU ready

(For the project I used turin.ee.ucl.ac.uk, I checked whether it woeks on this server, I strongly suggest that you test the project on the server)
You can simply check by input:

```python
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

If the output is `True`, then congratulation that you can start from the training by exectuting the corresponding file to solve the Task A and B. However, you should always train the SRResnet before training the SRGAN as the weights of SRResnet are needed when training SRGAN.

#### This means for task A the training sequence should be:

[train_srresnet_A.py](.\train_srresnet_A.py) -> [train_srgan_A.py](.\train_srgan_A.py)

#### For task B the training sequence should be:

[train_srresnet_B.py](.\train_srresnet_B.py) -> [train_srgan_B.py](.\train_srgan_B.py)

### You can also just check the result by executing the eval funciton

#### For task A it would be executing:


* [eval_srresnet_A.py](.\eval_srresnet_A.py)
* [eval_srgan_A.py](.\eval_srgan_A.py)
`

#### For task B it would be executing:


* [eval_srresnet_B.py](.\eval_srresnet_B.py)
* [eval_srgan_B.py](.\eval_srgan_B.py)
